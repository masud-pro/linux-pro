Package Requirements and Bash Script Updates
I want to update my bash script to handle package requirements and provide the following functionalities:

1. Check for Package Existence and Version :
Functionality:
The script should verify if the package is already installed.
If installed, display the current version and prompt the user to upgrade if an update is available.

User Interaction:
Accept yes or no as input, with Enter defaulting to yes.


2. Handle Dependencies :
Functionality:
Before installing the package, check for required dependencies.
Prompt the user to confirm the installation of dependencies.
After successfully installing dependencies, proceed to install the package.

User Interaction:
Accept yes or no as input, with Enter defaulting to yes.

3. Force Install Parameter (--force):
Functionality:
If the script is run with the --force parameter (e.g., ./package.sh --force), reinstall the package regardless of whether it is already installed.

4. Reset Parameter (--reset) :
Functionality:
If the script is run with the --reset parameter, perform the following:
Completely uninstall the package, including log files, cache files, and other associated data.
Reinstall the package as a fresh installation.

5. Uninstall Parameter (--uninstall) :
Functionality:
If the package is installed and the --uninstall parameter is provided, completely remove the package and clean all related files from the system.

6. Use Version Parameter (--use) :
Functionality:
If the --use parameter is provided (e.g., ./package.sh --use):
Display the last 5 available versions of the package.
Check which of these versions are already installed on the system.
Prompt the user to select a version to set as active.

New Functionality:
If the selected version is already installed, set it as active for the system.
If the selected version is not installed, install it first, then set it as active.


7. Set Default Version Parameter (--use XX.x)
Functionality:
If a specific version is provided with the --use parameter (e.g., ./package.sh --use 1.2.3):
Set the specified version as the default version for the system.
